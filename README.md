# BitcoLoan
<a href="https://bitcoloan.com/?utm_source=github">BitcoLoan</a> is a peer-to-peer crypto lending platform – we help those who need money find  people willing to bail them out. It wouldn’t be so easy without our quick search feature though; with its help lenders and borrowers can find a relevant offer in just a couple of minutes.

BitcoLoan is not a bank or some financial institution. Most importantly, our company helps people find what they’re looking for. If a person is in desperate need of money, BitcoLoan finds them a lender. Among other things, we offer a bunch of investment options for those who seek to make their assets work for them. 

## Investing in Individual and Business loans

An individual loan is a loan issued to one person with up to 1.2% daily interest rate. It gives people an opportunity to get instant loans on favourable terms without intermediaries. 

Business loans are group loans for businesses. In a business loan, a group of investors raises money for a certain business. A business loan term is between 90 and 360 days with up to 1.5% daily interest rate. 

Due to the difficult economic situation caused by pandemic and many other things, business owners need a lot of money to stay afloat. Sadly, banks turn down their loan requests. BitcoLoan lenders, in turn,  give businesses a hand by lending them money.
